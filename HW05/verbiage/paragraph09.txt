We are brought into sympathy with Christ through the fellowship of His sufferings. Every act of self-sacrifice for the good of others strengthens 
the spirit of beneficence in the giver's heart, allying him more closely to the Redeemer of the world, who was rich, yet for your sakes became 
poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich. And it is only as we thus fulfill the divine purpose in our creation that life 
can be a blessing to us.
